Notebooks starting with "DEP" are deprecated, which means that the reader is mostly just wasting their time due to erroneus methods or values or simply due to redundant information. These are preserved for transparency and documentation purposes.

# Migrate_paavodata.R 
This script is taken from Johan Himberg (jhimberg) from github to migrate Paavo (Open data by postal code area) from Statistics Finland and stores them into a list of data frames. 

# Coordinates.txt
This data is taken from www.geonames.org for getting longitude/latitude of each zip. " lat/lng are determined with an algorithm that searches the place names in the main geonames database 
using administrative divisions and numerical vicinity of the postal codes as factors in the disambiguation of place names. 
For postal codes and place name for which no corresponding toponym in the main geonames database could be found an average 
lat/lng of 'neighbouring' postal codes is calculated." -Geonames readme.txt 

# Preprocessing(R)md
This is the first prerocessing file that joins donor data and paavodata together. 

# dep.datavisualisation.(R)md
This is the first attempt to visualise Paavo data with donor data. Donor data hasn't been aggregated at this point, so plots in this markdown arent very informative. 

# Huuma.(R)md
This markdown is deprecated. It shows very similar plots with filtered visualisation.

# Preprocessing_with_site_codes(R)md. 
Same as preprocessing(R)md except data is filtered by four fixed donation sites. 

# Map 
Empty file, but was uploaded for showing r packages and code that opens shp.files.  Nothing to see here yet. 

# Filtered. visualisation 
Similar file to Huuma.md  and not really informative. 
# Distance.calculating
 Deprecated file and no other purpose to be here except transparency. 

# Visualisation.(R).md 
This is the first attempt to explore the aggregated data. 

# Distance function
Join geonames file with dataset  and calculates distance to nearest fixed site. 

# Visualising model data
Latest exploration data file which is still work in progress.
