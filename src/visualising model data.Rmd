#facet_grid(Year~.)

#There seems to be quite a number of areas with high proportion of donors and lower than 20k median income. After checking this, it seems that areas are all from Lahti. Also need to pay attention that im not visualising the years separately, so  there are same data points with different year. it seems that there could be  (mild)  positive correlation between median income and proportion of donors, but only to some degree so that richest ares do not have highest prop donors and there are areas with high prop of donors and less than 20k median income, so there might be even negative correlation.  I would guess that Helsinki would fit to linear model better, than the whole dataset.

This is in line with common sense since donations are measured by dividing the population size with number of donors.

Im not sure that the downfall is as drastic as it is with median income.
