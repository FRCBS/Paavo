# Is there a relationship of income and proportion of donors in the population? 
filtering prop_donors smaller than 1 and took common logarithm 
```{r}
preprosessed_paavo %>% 
filter(prop_donors<=1) %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = averageincome, y= prop_donors)) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
scale_x_log10() +
facet_grid(Year~.)
```

# basic for averageincome and proportion of donors. 
```{r}
preprosessed_paavo %>% 
ggplot(aes( x= averageincome, y= prop_donors))+
geom_point()+
facet_grid(Year~.)
```
# basic plot for median. 
```{r}

#Logarithm and filtering. 

```{r}

filter(prop_donors<=1) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y = prop_donors, x = medianincome)) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +

```




same plot separately for first time donors and others






 Is there a relationship between proportion of people with higher education and proportion of donors in the population? 
 
  a. Scatter plot Y= proportion of donors in a zip code X = proportion inhabitants with higher education
        
```{r}
preprosessed_paavo %>% 
ggplot(aes( x= proportion_inhabitants_with_higher_education, y= nb_donation_per_act_donor)) + 
geom_count()+
facet_grid(Year~.)
```
